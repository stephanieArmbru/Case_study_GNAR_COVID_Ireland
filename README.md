R code for paper Armbruster and Reinert, 2023, "Case study for network-based time series models: COVID-19 incidence in the Republic of Ireland"

The structure of the code is modular. <br />
Folder Data includes the following datasets: <br />
• COVID-19_HPSC_County_Statistics_Historic_Data.csv: data set with daily cumulative COVID-19 incidence from Ordnance Survey Ireland, 2022 <br />
• ireland_covid_weekly.csv: data set after pre-processing <br />
• ireland_covid_weekly_2.csv: data with lag-2 COVID-19 incidences after pre-processing <br />
• ireland_shapefile.shp: shapefile for plotting network maps, generated by saving data downloaded from the GADM database <br />
• county_towns_ireland.csv: data set with coordinates for Irish counties from the Ireland Cities Database on simplemaps <br />
• Folder RObjects: contains networks (as GNAR and igraph objects) as well as subsetted data according to COVID-19 regulations <br />

The file functions_paper.R includes all functions written to pre-process data, fit GNAR models, analyse and plot residuals etc. In order to incorporate the alternative weighting schemes, the functions GNARdesign(), GNARfit() and NofNeighbours() from the package GNAR had to be expanded. The adapted functions GNARdesign_weighting(), GNARfit_weighting() and NofNeighbours_named() are included in the files GNARdesign.R, GNARfit.R and NofNeighbours.R in the folder GNAR. <br />

The file Data_processing.R performs some initial data exploration, the data aggregation to a weekly level and the necessary smoothing for extreme peaks in COVID-19 incidence. <br />
The file Data_processing_restrictions.R processes the data according to COVID-19 restrictions and summarises the datasets belonging to restricted and unrestricted pandemic phases. <br />
The COVID-19 networks are constructed in the file Network_construction.R. <br />
The GNAR models are fit to the restricted and unrestricted datasets, MASE values plotted and residuals testes in the file Model_fitting.R. <br />

The file SM_Model_fitting_entire_datasets.R fits GNAR models to the entire dataset. <br />

The folder Figures contains all generated figures for the paper.
